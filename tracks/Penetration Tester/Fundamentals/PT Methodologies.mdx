# PT Methodologies

You don't just "hack". You follow a process.
A methodology ensures you cover all bases and provide consistent results.

## The Standard: PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

1.  **Pre-engagement Interactions:** Scoping, RoE.
2.  **Intelligence Gathering (Recon):** OSINT, Scanning.
3.  **Threat Modeling:** What are we attacking? How?
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Finding the holes.
5.  **Exploitation:** Breaking in.
6.  **Post Exploitation:** Looting, Pivoting, Persistence.
7.  **Reporting:** Writing it all down.

## Black, White, and Gray Box

*   **Black Box:** No prior knowledge. Simulates an external attacker.
*   **White Box:** Full access (source code, diagrams). Simulates an insider or thorough audit.
*   **Gray Box:** Partial access (user credentials). The most common type of pentest.
