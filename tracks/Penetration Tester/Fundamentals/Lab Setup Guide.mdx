# Lab Setup Guide

For this track, the generic tools aren't enough. You need the **Pentester's Arsenal**.

## 1. Burp Suite (The Proxy)

The most important tool for Web Application Pentesting.
It sits between your browser and the server, letting you pause, modify, and replay requests.

*   **Intercept Mode:** Stops the request so you can edit it.
*   **Repeater:** Send the same request multiple times with tweaks.
*   **Intruder:** Fuzzing and brute-forcing.

## 2. Metasploit Framework

The framework for exploitation.
*   **Exploits:** Code that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Payloads:** Code that runs *after* the exploit (e.g., Reverse Shell).

## 3. Wordlists (SecLists)
You cannot guess passwords. You crack them using lists.
We use **SecLists**.
Location: `/usr/share/seclists/`

## Configuration Task

Ensure you have **FoxyProxy** installed in your browser to switch traffic to Burp Suite easily.
