# Ethics & Legal Issues

Before you touch a keyboard, you must understand the rules of engagement.
Penetration Testing is authorized hacking. Without authorization, it is a crime.

## The Difference Between White Hat and Black Hat

*   **White Hat (Ethical Hacker):** Has permission. Goals: Improve security.
*   **Black Hat (Malicious Hacker):** No permission. Goals: Gain, damage, or fun.
*   **Gray Hat:** Ambiguous. Often hacks first, asks later. **Illegal in most jurisdictions.**

## Legal Frameworks

### 1. CMA (Computer Misuse Act - UK)
*   **Section 1:** Unauthorized access to computer material.
*   **Section 3:** Unauthorized acts with intent to impair operation (Denial of Service).

### 2. CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act - US)
The primary federal anti-hacking statute in the US.

## Rules of Engagement (RoE)

The contract that saves you from jail.
It **must** specify:
1.  **Scope:** What IPs/URLs are fair game?
2.  **Timeline:** When can we test? (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM)
3.  **Emergency Contact:** Who do we call if we break production?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Never** go out of scope. If you find a vulnerability on a system not in the list, **stop** and report it immediately. Do not exploit it.
