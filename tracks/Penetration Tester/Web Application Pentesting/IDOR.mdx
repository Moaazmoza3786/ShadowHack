# IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

A fancy name for: "Changing the ID number in the URL."
It happens when the application believes you just because you asked for it.

## The Theory

You are User 100 on `profile.php?id=100`.
You change it to `profile.php?id=101`.
If you see User 101's profile, that's IDOR. The system failed to check if **you** are authorized to see **101**.

## Common Locations

*   URL Parameters: `?id=`, `?user=`, `?account=`
*   POST Body forms.
*   API Identifiers: `/api/v1/users/12345`

## Lab: The Hospital Record

You are authorized to view your own medical record (ID: 2500).
Can you view the CEO's record (ID: 1)?

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="curl http://hospital.local/records?id=1" 
  output="{
  'id': 1,
  'patient': 'CEO John Doe',
  'diagnosis': 'Stress',
  'notes': 'Flag: BL{ID0R_Is_Everywh3re}'
}" 
/>

The application checked IF you were logged in, but not IF you owned record #1.
