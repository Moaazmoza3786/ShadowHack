# Passive Recon

Reconnaissance is the most critical phase. If you miss a server, you can't hack it.
**Passive Recon** means gathering info **without** touching the target's infrastructure. They should not know you are there.

## Sources of Intel

1.  **Whois:** Domain registration info. (Emails, Names, Addresses).
2.  **DNS Dumpster:** Subdomains and mapping.
3.  **Social Media:** Employee names, technologies used (LinkedIn is gold).
4.  **Google Dorks:** Advanced search queries.

## Google Dorking

Using search operators to find sensitive files.

*   `site:target.com filetype:pdf` (Find public documents)
*   `site:target.com intitle:"index of"` (Directory listing)
*   `site:github.com "target.com" password` (Particularly dangerous)

## Lab: The Wayback Machine

The internet never forgets. Retrieve a deleted page from `archive.org`.
We found an old version of the target's contact page.

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="curl http://wayback.archive.org/web/20230101/target.com/contact.html" 
  output="<html>
...
<!-- DEPRECATED: Dev Server Access -->
<!-- User: developer / Pass: BL{W4yB4ck_Tim3_M4chin3} -->
...
</html>" 
/>

The developer left credentials in a comment, then deleted the page. But the archive kept it.
