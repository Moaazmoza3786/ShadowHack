# C2 Frameworks

Command and Control (C2).
You don't manage 100 infected machines with 100 Netcat listeners.
You use a C2 framework.

## The Big Players

*   **Cobalt Strike:** The gold standard. Expensive.
*   **Sliver:** Open source, Go-based. Powerful.
*   **Covenant:** .NET based C2.
*   **Empire:** PowerShell focused (Legacy but active).

## Lab: Beacong

We have an agent checking in every 10 seconds (Jitter).
Execute a command on the agent.

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="Sliver > use session 1" 
  output="[*] Active session 1 (DESKTOP-USER)
Sliver (session) > shell
[*] Tasked session 1 to run shell (ID: 1f3a...)
[+] Task 1f3a completed.
C:\Users\User> type flag.txt
BL{C2_Infra_Mast3r}" 
/>
