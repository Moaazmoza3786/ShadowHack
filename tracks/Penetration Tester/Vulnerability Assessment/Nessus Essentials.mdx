# Nessus Essentials

Nessus is the industry standard for vulnerability scanning.
It has a database of over 100,000 plugins (checks) for CVEs.

## Key Components

1.  **Policies:** Configuration rules (e.g., "Basic Network Scan", "Credentialed Patch Audit").
2.  **Plugins:** The scripts that check for specific bugs.
3.  **Severity Model:**
    *   **Critical:** Exploitable immediately (Shell, RCE).
    *   **High:** Exploitable but hard, or Data Loss.
    *   **Medium:** DoS or specific conditions needed.
    *   **Low/Info:** Information disclosure.

## Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed

*   **Non-Credentialed:** Scans from the outside. Sees what a hacker sees.
*   **Credentialed:** Logs in to the machine. Checks software versions, registry keys, and missing patches. **Much more accurate.**

## Lab: Analyzing a Report

We ran a scan against `Target-A`.
Finding: **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)**.
Severity: **Critical**.

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="cat nessus_report.csv | grep MS17-010" 
  output="Host: 10.10.10.95
Risk: Critical
Name: MS17-010: Security Update for SMB Server (EternalBlue)
Hidden: BL{Vuln_Sc4nn3r_Pr0}" 
/>

This vulnerability allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) via SMB. It's game over.
