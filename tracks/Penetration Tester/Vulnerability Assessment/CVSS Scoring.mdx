# CVSS Scoring

How do you compare a formatting bug to a database leak?
You use the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**.

## The Calculator

CVSS generates a score from 0.0 to 10.0 based on three metric groups:
1.  **Base:** Intrinsic qualities (constant over time).
2.  **Temporal:** Changes over time (e.g., is there a patch?).
3.  **Environmental:** Specific to <i>your</i> environment.

## The Vector String

`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` (Score: 9.8 - Critical)

*   **AV (Attack Vector):** Network (N), Local (L), Physical (P).
*   **AC (Attack Complexity):** Low (L), High (H).
*   **PR (Privileges Required):** None (N), Low (L), High (H).
*   **C/I/A:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact.

## Lab: Score It

Vulnerability: An unsecured S3 bucket containing customer credit cards.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network (Publicly accessible).
*   **Complexity:** Low (Just browse the URL).
*   **Privileges:** None.
*   **Confidentiality:** High.
*   **Integrity:** Low (Read-only usually).
*   **Availability:** None.

Calculated Score: **7.5 (High)**.

Wait, if Integrity is impacted (someone *could* delete files), the score jumps.
