# Linux Fundamentals 1: Navigation

The Linux terminal is your cockpit. As a cybersecurity professional, you will live here. 
Graphical interfaces (GUIs) are slow and limited. The Command Line Interface (CLI) is where power lives.

In this module, we will cover the absolute essentials: **Navigation**.

## essential Commands

| Command | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pwd` | Print Working Directory | Tells you where you are. |
| `ls` | List | Shows you what is in the current directory. |
| `cd` | Change Directory | Moves you to a different folder. |
| `cat` | Concatenate | Displays the contents of a file. |

## 1. Where am I? (`pwd`)

Unlike a GUI file explorer, the terminal doesn't visually show your current folder by default. You ask it.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
user@breachlabs:~$ pwd
/home/user
</CodeBlock>

## 2. What is here? (`ls`)

Use `ls` to list files. Add arguments like `-l` (long format) or `-a` (all files, including hidden ones) for more info.

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="ls -la" 
  output="total 42
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 11 10:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jan 01 00:00 ..
-rw------- 1 user user  512 Jan 11 10:01 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user   24 Jan 11 10:02 flag.txt" 
/>

> [!NOTE]
> Files starting with a dot `.` are hidden. You won't see them with a standard `ls`.

## 3. Moving Around (`cd`)

To enter a directory, use `cd <directory_name>`.
To go back one level, use `cd ..`.

```bash
cd Downloads    # Enter 'Downloads'
cd ..           # Go back to parent
cd /            # Go to root
cd ~            # Go to home directory
```

## 4. Reading Files (`cat`)

To see what's inside a text file, simply `cat` it.

```bash
cat note.txt
```

## Mission: Find the Flag

You have been dropped into a directory with a hidden secret. 
Use your skills to navigate the system and read the contents of `flag.txt`.

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="cat flag.txt" 
  output="Access Granted.
Flag: BL{L1nux_N4v1gat0r_Pr0}" 
/>

Enter the flag below to complete the module.

<Quiz 
  question="What is the flag found in the hidden file?"
  options={[
    "BL{Linux_Is_Hard}",
    "BL{L1nux_N4v1gat0r_Pr0}",
    "BL{Root_Access_Denied}",
    "admin123"
  ]}
/>
