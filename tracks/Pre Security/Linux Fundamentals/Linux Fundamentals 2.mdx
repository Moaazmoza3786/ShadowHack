# Linux Fundamentals 2: Manipulation

Now that you can move around, it's time to learn how to manipulate the environment.
In this module, we cover searching, copying, moving, and deleting.

## The Toolkit

| Command | Usage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `grep` | `grep "text" file` | Search for a specific string inside a file. |
| `cp` | `cp source dest` | Copy a file or directory. |
| `mv` | `mv source dest` | Move (or rename) a file. |
| `rm` | `rm file` | Delete (Remove) a file. **Permanent.** |

## 1. Searching with `grep`

`grep` is powerful. It allows you to sift through massive log files to find the one line you need.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
# Search for "error" in application.log
grep "error" application.log

# Case insensitive search
grep -i "Error" application.log
</CodeBlock>

## 2. Copying and Moving (`cp`, `mv`)

<TerminalWindow 
  cmd="cp secret.txt backup_secret.txt && mv backup_secret.txt /tmp/" 
  output="" 
/>

*   `cp`: Creates a duplicate.
*   `mv`: Moves the original (or renames it if the destination is a filename).

## 3. The Dangerous `rm`

There is no "Trash Bin" in the CLI. When you `rm` a file, it is gone.

> [!CAUTION]
> Be extremely careful with `rm -rf`. This recursively modifies and forces deletion of directories. Running this on `/` (root) will destroy the operating system.

## Mission: The Needle in the Haystack

We have intercepted a communication log file `server_logs.txt`. It contains thousands of entries.
The attacker left a trace referencing "BreachLabs".
Find the line containing "BreachLabs" to get the flag.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
user@breachlabs:~$ grep "BreachLabs" server_logs.txt
[2024-01-11 14:02:11] INFO: Connection established to remote host BL{Gr3p_M4st3r_X}
</CodeBlock>

<Quiz 
  question="What flag was hidden in the logs?"
  options={[
    "BL{Linux_Logs_Secure}",
    "BL{Gr3p_M4st3r_X}",
    "BL{Rm_Rf_Danger}",
    "Log_Entry_Found"
  ]}
/>
