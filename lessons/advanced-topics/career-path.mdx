# The Pentester's Career Path (Certs & Jobs)

## So You Want to be a Hacker?
The path is not linear. You don't need a CS degree, but you need **Curiosity** and **Persistence**.

## 1. The Certification Roadmap
Certifications get you past HR filters. Skills get you the job.

### Entry Level
-   **Security+ (CompTIA):** The baseline. Theory only, but respected by HR.
-   **eJPT (eLearnSecurity):** 100% Practical. The best "first" pentesting cert.

### The Gold Standard
-   **OSCP (OffSec Certified Professional):** The "Gatekeeper" cert. A 24-hour brutal exam. If you have this, you will get interviews.

### Advanced
-   **CPTS (HackTheBox):** Harder than OSCP, very modern. Gaining respect rapidly.
-   **PNPT (TCM Security):** Focuses on "Real World" pentesting (OSINT, AD, Reporting) rather than just CTF tricks.

## 2. Building a Portfolio
-   **GitHub:** Write your own tools. Even a simple "Python Port Scanner" shows you can code.
-   **Blog:** Write about machines you hacked (HackTheBox writeups). It shows you can communicate technical concepts.
-   **CVEs:** If you find a 0-day in a small open-source app, report it. Getting a CVE ID is a golden ticket.

## 3. The Job Hunt
-   **Titles:** Junior Penetration Tester, Security Analyst, SOC Analyst (often a stepping stone), Associate Consultant.
-   **The Interview:** They will ask technical questions ("Explain the difference between encoding and encryption", "How does a buffer overflow work?"). They might give you a "test ip" to hack during the interview.

## 4. Soft Skills
Being a Pentester is 50% Hacking, 50% Consulting.
-   **Reporting:** If you can't write a report that a CEO understands, you are useless to the client.
-   **Ethics:** You will see sensitive data. Integrity is non-negotiable.
