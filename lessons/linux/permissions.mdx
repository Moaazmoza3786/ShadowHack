# File Permissions

Security in Linux is built around permissions. Every file has an owner and a group, and specific permissions for each.

## Understanding `ls -l`

When you run `ls -l`, you see something like this:
`-rwxr-xr--`

- The first character is the type (`-` for file, `d` for directory).
- The next 3 are for the **Owner** (User).
- The next 3 are for the **Group**.
- The last 3 are for **Others**.

### Permission Types
- `r`: Read (4)
- `w`: Write (2)
- `x`: Execute (1)

## Changing Permissions

We use the `chmod` command to change permissions.
`chmod 755 file.txt` (Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: r-x).

<TerminalWindow 
  title="Checking Permissions" 
  command="ls -l /etc/shadow" 
  output="-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1240 Jan 12 10:00 /etc/shadow" 
/>

<InfoBox type="warning">
The `/etc/shadow` file contains hashed passwords. Only root should be able to read it!
</InfoBox>
