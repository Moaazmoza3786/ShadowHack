# Terminal Navigation

To be a hacker, you must be comfortable moving around the terminal. It's much faster than using a GUI.

## Essential Commands

### 1. `pwd` (Print Working Directory)
Shows you exactly where you are in the filesystem.

### 2. `ls` (List)
Lists the files and folders in your current directory.
- `ls -l`: Long format (shows permissions/size).
- `ls -a`: Shows hidden files (starting with a dot `.`).

### 3. `cd` (Change Directory)
Moves you into a different directory.
- `cd ..`: Move up one level.
- `cd ~`: Go to your home directory.
- `cd -`: Go back to the previous directory.
