# Process Management

A process is a running instance of a program. In Linux, you can view, stop, and prioritize these processes.

## Viewing Processes

### 1. `ps` (Process Status)
Shows the processes running in your current shell.
- `ps aux`: Shows all processes from all users.

### 2. `top` or `htop`
Provides a real-time view of running processes and system resources.

## Killing Processes

Sometimes a program freezes or needs to be stopped. We use the `kill` command.
`kill -9 1234` (Where 1234 is the Process ID or PID).

<TerminalWindow 
  title="Checking Processes" 
  command="ps aux | grep 'apache'" 
  output="root  1024  0.0  0.1  apache2" 
/>

<InfoBox type="info">
The `kill -9` signal is the "force kill" signal. It tells the kernel to stop the process immediately.
