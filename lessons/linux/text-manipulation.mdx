# Text Manipulation

In Linux, everything is text. Being able to search, filter, and modify text is a superpower.

## The Power of Grep

`grep` searches for patterns in files.
`grep "error" /var/log/syslog`

### Piping (`|`)
You can send the output of one command to another using the pipe.
`cat file.txt | grep "admin"`

## Sed & Awk
- **Sed:** Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
- **Awk:** A powerful programming language for pattern scanning and processing.

<TerminalWindow 
  title="Filtering Users" 
  command="cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 | grep 'root'" 
  output="root" 
/>

<InfoBox type="tip">
Use `grep -i` for case-insensitive searches and `grep -v` to invert the match (show lines that DON'T match).
</InfoBox>
