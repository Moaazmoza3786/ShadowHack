# Linux Directory Structure

Linux follows a hierarchical structure that is very different from Windows.

## The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

Everything starts from the root directory: `/`.

- `/bin`: Essential user binaries (ls, cp, mv, ping).
- `/sbin`: System binaries, usually for the administrator (iptables, fdisk).
- `/etc`: Configuration files for the system and apps.
- `/home`: Personal directories for users.
- `/root`: The home directory for the superuser (root).
- `/tmp`: Temporary files (often cleared on reboot).
- `/var`: Variable files like logs (`/var/log`) and mail.
- `/dev`: Device files (everything is a file in Linux!).

<InfoBox type="important">
Pentesters often check `/etc/passwd` to see a list of users and `/tmp` for a place to hide tools.

/>

<Quiz 
  question="Which directory contains the system's configuration files?" 
  answer="/etc" 
  hint="It rhymes with 'setc'." 
/>

<Quiz 
  question="Where are user log files usually stored?" 
  answer="/var/log" 
  hint="It's inside the variable directory."
