# MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Industry Standard">
MITRE ATT&CK is the **universal language** for describing adversary behavior. Every security vendor, every threat report, and every mature SOC uses it.
</InfoBox>

## What is MITRE ATT&CK?

**ATT&CK** stands for **Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge**.

It's a knowledge base of adversary behavior based on real-world observations:
- **14 Tactics** (adversary goals)
- **200+ Techniques** (methods to achieve goals)
- **500+ Sub-techniques** (specific implementations)
- **100+ Groups** (threat actors)
- **500+ Software** (malware and tools)

## Using the ATT&CK Navigator

The **ATT&CK Navigator** is a web-based tool for visualizing and working with the matrix.

<InfoBox type="info" title="Access Navigator">
🔗 https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/
</InfoBox>

### Key Features

1. **Create Layers** - Custom views of the matrix
2. **Color Techniques** - Highlight based on your criteria
3. **Score Techniques** - Rate coverage or priority
4. **Add Metadata** - Notes, links, comments
5. **Compare Layers** - Overlay multiple views

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Detection Coverage Analysis

Map your current detections to ATT&CK:

<TerminalWindow title="Detection Coverage Layer">
# Example: Rate each technique by detection capability

Score Legend:
0 = No detection
1 = Partial/Low confidence detection
2 = Good detection, manual analysis needed
3 = High confidence, automated alert
4 = Full coverage with context/enrichment

Example Scores:
T1059.001 (PowerShell): 3 - ScriptBlock logging enabled
T1003.001 (LSASS Memory): 2 - Sysmon Event 10 detection
T1021.002 (SMB Shares): 1 - Network logs only
T1486 (Data Encrypted): 0 - No ransomware detection
</TerminalWindow>

### 2. Threat Actor Mapping

Visualize which techniques a specific group uses:

<TerminalWindow title="APT29 (Cozy Bear) Techniques">
Initial Access:
✓ T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment
✓ T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link

Execution:
✓ T1059.001 - PowerShell
✓ T1059.003 - Windows Command Shell
✓ T1204.002 - Malicious File

Defense Evasion:
✓ T1027 - Obfuscated Files
✓ T1055 - Process Injection
✓ T1070.004 - File Deletion

Credential Access:
✓ T1003.001 - LSASS Memory
✓ T1003.003 - NTDS

Command and Control:
✓ T1071.001 - Web Protocols
✓ T1071.004 - DNS
</TerminalWindow>

### 3. Gap Analysis

Compare threat actor techniques against your detection coverage:

```
Your Coverage Layer    +    APT29 Layer    =    Gap Analysis
(Green = Covered)           (Red = Used)        (Red on White = RISK)
```

## Practical Navigator Exercise

<ChallengeBox 
  title="Build a Coverage Layer"
  difficulty="medium"
  points={100}
>

Create an ATT&CK Navigator layer for a SOC with these detection capabilities:

**Available Detections**:
1. Sysmon installed (Events 1, 3, 7, 10, 11)
2. PowerShell ScriptBlock logging enabled
3. Windows Security Event logs (4624, 4625, 4648, 4672)
4. Network IDS (Suricata)
5. EDR with behavioral detection

**Task**: List 5 techniques you SHOULD be able to detect and 5 techniques you probably CANNOT detect.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**CAN Detect (Score 2-3)**:
1. T1059.001 (PowerShell) - ScriptBlock logging
2. T1003.001 (LSASS Memory) - Sysmon Event 10
3. T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys) - Sysmon Event 13
4. T1021.001 (RDP) - Event 4624 Type 10
5. T1055 (Process Injection) - Sysmon Event 8

**CANNOT Detect (Score 0-1)**:
1. T1027.002 (Software Packing) - No unpacking capability
2. T1071.004 (DNS C2) - No DNS monitoring
3. T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol) - Limited network visibility
4. T1134 (Token Manipulation) - Requires advanced kernel logging
5. T1550.002 (Pass the Hash) - Hard without advanced correlation

## Best Practices

1. **Start with threat actors** relevant to your industry
2. **Focus on high-frequency techniques** (PowerShell, Command Line, etc.)
3. **Update regularly** as you add new detections
4. **Share with your team** - Navigator layers are portable
5. **Use for tabletop exercises** - Walk through attack chains

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Don't Aim for 100%">
No organization can detect everything. Prioritize based on **threat relevance** and **business risk**.
</InfoBox>
