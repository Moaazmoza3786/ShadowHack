# Incident Response Lifecycle

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Why This Matters">
As a SOC Analyst, understanding the incident lifecycle is your **foundation**. Every alert you investigate follows this framework, whether it's a phishing attempt or a full-scale breach.
</InfoBox>

## The NIST Incident Response Framework

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** Special Publication 800-61 defines a four-phase approach to incident handling:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Preparation   │ ──▶ │   Detection &   │ ──▶ │  Containment,   │ ──▶ │ Post-Incident   │
│                 │     │   Analysis      │     │  Eradication &  │     │    Activity     │
│                 │     │                 │     │   Recovery      │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Phase 1: Preparation

This is **before** the incident happens. Think of it as building your arsenal.

### Key Activities:
- **Build the IR Team**: Define roles (Incident Handler, Forensics, Legal, PR)
- **Create Playbooks**: Step-by-step runbooks for common incidents
- **Deploy Tools**: SIEM, EDR, Network Monitoring
- **Establish Communication**: Secure channels, escalation paths
- **Conduct Training**: Tabletop exercises, red team drills

<TerminalWindow title="Example: IR Team Structure">
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM STRUCTURE                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ IR Manager          │ Overall coordination                  │
│ Tier 1 Analyst      │ Initial triage, alert handling       │
│ Tier 2 Analyst      │ Deep analysis, threat hunting        │
│ Tier 3 / Forensics  │ Malware analysis, disk/memory        │
│ Legal Counsel       │ Regulatory, evidence handling         │
│ Communications      │ Internal/external messaging           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</TerminalWindow>

## Phase 2: Detection & Analysis

This is where you **identify** and **understand** the incident.

### Detection Sources:
| Source | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **SIEM Alerts** | Failed logins, suspicious processes |
| **EDR** | Malware detection, behavioral anomalies |
| **User Reports** | Phishing emails, unusual activity |
| **Threat Intel** | IOC matches, dark web mentions |
| **Network Tools** | IDS/IPS alerts, DNS anomalies |

### Analysis Steps:
1. **Triage**: Is this a true positive or false positive?
2. **Scope**: How many systems are affected?
3. **Attribution**: What type of threat actor?
4. **Timeline**: When did it start?

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Common Mistake">
Don't rush to containment! Incomplete analysis can mean you miss the attacker's persistence mechanisms.
</InfoBox>

---

## Phase 3: Containment, Eradication & Recovery

### Containment
Stop the bleeding **without tipping off the attacker** (if possible).

- **Short-term**: Isolate affected systems, block IPs
- **Long-term**: Rebuild from clean images, patch vulnerabilities

<TerminalWindow title="Example: Network Isolation">
# Block malicious IP at firewall
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 185.220.101.45 -j DROP

# Isolate host from network (Windows)
> netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
> netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block All" dir=in action=block

# EDR Isolation (CrowdStrike example)
$ falconctl -g --aid | xargs -I {} curl -X POST "api/hosts/{}/contain"
</TerminalWindow>

### Eradication
Remove the threat completely:
- Delete malware files
- Remove persistence (scheduled tasks, registry keys)
- Revoke compromised credentials
- Patch exploited vulnerabilities

### Recovery
Return to normal operations:
- Restore from clean backups
- Monitor closely for re-infection
- Validate system integrity
- Gradually restore network access

## Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity

<InfoBox type="tip" title="The Most Neglected Phase">
This is where organizations **learn and improve**. Skip this, and you'll fight the same battles repeatedly.
</InfoBox>

### Key Deliverables:
1. **Incident Report**: Timeline, actions taken, impact
2. **Lessons Learned**: What worked? What failed?
3. **Playbook Updates**: Improve runbooks based on findings
4. **Metrics**: Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)

## Practical Exercise

<ChallengeBox 
  title="Incident Classification"
  difficulty="easy"
  points={50}
>
Given the following alert, classify it according to NIST severity levels:

**Alert**: Multiple failed SSH login attempts from IP 203.0.113.42 targeting the production database server. 50 attempts in 5 minutes.

**Question**: Which phase of the incident lifecycle should you be in right now?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Phase**: Detection & Analysis

**Next Steps**:
1. Check if the IP is in your threat intel feeds
2. Review if any login succeeded
3. Check for other targets from the same IP
4. Determine if this is automated scanning or targeted attack
</details>

## Key Takeaways

- The NIST framework provides a **structured approach** to incident handling
- **Preparation** is the foundation – invest in it before incidents occur
- **Analysis** before action prevents incomplete remediation
- **Post-incident review** drives continuous improvement
