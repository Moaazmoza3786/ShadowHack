# Wireshark Analysis

Wireshark is the world's foremost network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what's happening on your network at a microscopic level.

## Key Features

- **Capture:** Grab live traffic from a network interface.
- **Filters:** Use Display Filters to find exactly what you're looking for (e.g., `http.request.method == "POST"`).
- **Streams:** "Follow TCP Stream" to see the entire conversation in a human-readable format.

<PacketView

  dest="10.10.10.1" 
  protocol="HTTP" 
  flags="POST /login" 
  seq="200"

<InfoBox type="important">
If traffic is encrypted (HTTPS), you won't be able to see the data unless you have the private key or use a proxy like Burp Suite.
