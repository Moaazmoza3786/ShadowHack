# Password Cracking

Hashing is a one-way process. To "crack" a password, we must hash millions of possible passwords and compare them to the target hash.

## Hash Types
- **MD5:** Old, fast, and insecure.
- **SHA-1:** Older, also considered weak.
- **SHA-256:** Modern and secure.
- **Bcrypt:** Designed to be slow (expensive), making it very hard to crack.

## Core Tools

### 1. John the Ripper (JtR)
A versatile tool that supports hundreds of hash types.

### 2. Hashcat
The world's fastest password cracker. It uses the power of your GPU to crack hashes at incredible speeds.

A good wordlist is essential. **Rockyou.txt** is the industry standard for CTFs and real-world testing.
