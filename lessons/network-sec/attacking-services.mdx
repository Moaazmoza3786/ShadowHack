# Attacking Services

Once you've identified open ports and running services, the next step is to look for vulnerabilities or weak configurations.

## Common Attacks

### 1. Anonymous Login (FTP)
Many FTP servers allow users to log in with the username `anonymous` and any password. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure.

### 2. Brute Forcing (SSH)
If you have a valid username, you can attempt to guess the password using tools like **Hydra**.

### 3. Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities (HTTP)
Web servers often run outdated software with known CVEs.

  command="hydra -l root -P passwords.txt ssh://10.10.10.5" 
  output="Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC\n[22][ssh] host: 10.10.10.5   login: root   password: password123" 
/>

<InfoBox type="warning">
Brute forcing is noisy and can lock out accounts. Always try default credentials first!
