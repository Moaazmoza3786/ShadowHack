# Nmap Mastery

Nmap (Network Mapper) is the "God mode" tool for network discovery and security auditing.

## Advanced Scan Types

### 1. SYN Scan (`-sS`)
The default and most popular scan. It's fast and relatively stealthy as it never completes the TCP 3-way handshake.

### 2. UDP Scan (`-sU`)
Scans UDP ports (like DNS, SNMP, and DHCP). UDP scans are much slower than TCP scans.

### 3. Service Version Detection (`-sV`)
Probes open ports to determine what service and version is actually running.

Use the `-T4` or `-T5` flags to speed up your scans, but be careful as higher speeds are more likely to be detected by IDS.
