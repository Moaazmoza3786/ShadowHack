# Metasploit Fundamentals

The **Metasploit Framework (MSF)** is an open-source project that provides infrastructure, content, and tools to perform penetration tests and security audits.

## Key Terminology

- **Exploit:** A sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability.
- **Payload:** The code that runs on the target system after successful exploitation (e.g., a reverse shell).
- **Module:** A piece of software that performs a specific task (Exploit, Auxiliary, Post, etc.).
- **Listener:** A component that waits for an incoming connection from the exploited target.
