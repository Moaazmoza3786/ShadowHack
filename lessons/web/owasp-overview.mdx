# OWASP Top 10 Overview

The **OWASP Top 10** is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

## Current Top Risks (Examples)

1. **Broken Access Control:** Users can access data or functions they shouldn't.
2. **Cryptographic Failures:** Sensitive data (like passwords) is not properly protected.
3. **Injection:** Malicious data is sent to an interpreter (SQL, Command).
4. **Insecure Design:** Security flaws built into the application's architecture.
5. **Security Misconfiguration:** Improperly configured servers or cloud permissions.

The OWASP Top 10 is updated every few years as new types of attacks emerge and others become less common.
