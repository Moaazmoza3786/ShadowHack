# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or deface websites.

## Types of XSS

1. **Reflected XSS:** The script is part of a URL or form submission and is reflected back to the user.
2. **Stored XSS:** The script is saved on the server (e.g., in a comment or profile) and shown to every user who views that page.
3. **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability exists entirely in the client-side code.

### Example Payload
`<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`

<InfoBox type="important">
Stored XSS is usually more dangerous because it can potentially affect every user of the application.
</InfoBox>

```javascript
// Vulnerable: Directly injecting user input into the DOM
document.getElementById('welcome').innerHTML = "Welcome, " + name;

// Secure: Using textContent to prevent script execution
document.getElementById('welcome').textContent = "Welcome, " + name;
```
