# IDOR & Broken Access Control

**IDOR** (Insecure Direct Object Reference) is a type of access control vulnerability that occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.

## The IDOR Concept

Imagine your user profile URL is `https://app.com/profile?id=123`.
What happens if you change it to `https://app.com/profile?id=124`?

If you can see User 124's private info, that's an IDOR!

<InfoBox type="info">
IDOR is a subset of "Broken Access Control", which is currently #1 in the OWASP Top 10.

### Horizontal vs Vertical Escalation
- **Horizontal:** Accessing data of another user with the same level of permissions.
- **Vertical:** Accessing data of a user with higher permissions (e.g., an Admin).
