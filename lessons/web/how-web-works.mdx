# How the Web Works

Every time you visit a website, your browser is having a conversation with a server. This conversation follows the **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) rules.

## The Request-Response Cycle

1. **Request:** Your browser sends a message to the server (e.g., "Give me index.html").
2. **Response:** The server sends back a message with a status code (e.g., "200 OK") and the data (HTML, CSS, JS).

<PacketView 
  source="Browser" 
  dest="Web Server" 
  protocol="HTTP" 
  flags="GET /" 
  seq="1" 
/>

## HTTP Verbs
- **GET:** Retrieve data.
- **POST:** Submit data (like a login form).
- **PUT:** Update data.
- **DELETE:** Remove data.

## Status Codes
- **200 OK:** Success!
- **404 Not Found:** The page doesn't exist.
- **500 Server Error:** Something went wrong on the server side.
