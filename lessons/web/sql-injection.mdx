# SQL Injection (SQLi)

SQL Injection is a vulnerability where an attacker can interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.

## How it Works

When an app takes user input and puts it directly into a SQL query without sanitizing it first.

### Simple Auth Bypass
Input: `admin' --`
Resulting Query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = '...';`

The `--` comments out the rest of the query, logging you in as admin without a password!

<InfoBox type="warning">
SQLi can lead to full database exfiltration or even remote code execution (RCE) on the server.
</InfoBox>

```sql
-- Vulnerable Code
"SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = " + request.query.id;

-- Secure Code (Parameterized)
"SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ?";
db.query(query, [request.query.id]);
```
