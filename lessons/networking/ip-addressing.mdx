# IP Addresses & Subnetting

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network.

## IPv4 vs IPv6
- **IPv4:** 32-bit address, usually written in four parts (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **IPv6:** 128-bit address, written in hexadecimal (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).

## Subnetting

Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into two or more smaller networks (subnets). This is done for security and performance reasons.

### The Subnet Mask
A subnet mask (like `255.255.255.0`) identifies which part of the IP address is the network address and which part is the host address.
