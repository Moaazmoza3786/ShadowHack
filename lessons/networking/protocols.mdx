# Common Ports & Protocols

Protocols are sets of rules that govern how data is exchanged. Ports are virtual "doors" that services use to communicate.

## Well-Known Ports

| Port | Protocol | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 21   | FTP      | File Transfer Protocol |
| 22   | SSH      | Secure Shell (Remote access) |
| 23   | Telnet   | Unencrypted remote access |
| 25   | SMTP     | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol |
| 53   | DNS      | Domain Name System |
| 80   | HTTP     | Hypertext Transfer Protocol |
| 443  | HTTPS    | HTTP Secure |

<InfoBox type="warning">
Telnet (Port 23) is insecure because it sends data in plain text. Always use SSH (Port 22) instead.
</InfoBox>
