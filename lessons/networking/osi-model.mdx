# The OSI Model

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)** model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. It divides the process of communication into seven distinct layers.

## The 7 Layers

1. **Application Layer (7):** Where users interact with the network (HTTP, FTP, DNS).
2. **Presentation Layer (6):** Handles data formatting and encryption (SSL, JPEG).
3. **Session Layer (5):** Manages connections between applications.
4. **Transport Layer (4):** Responsible for end-to-end communication (TCP, UDP).
5. **Network Layer (3):** Handles routing and IP addressing.
6. **Data Link Layer (2):** Handles physical addressing (MAC) and switching.
7. **Physical Layer (1):** The physical hardware (cables, bits).

Pentesters often focus on Layer 3 (Network), Layer 4 (Transport), and Layer 7 (Application).

## Encapsulation

As data moves down the layers, each layer adds its own header. This process is called **Encapsulation**.
