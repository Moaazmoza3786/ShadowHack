# Network Troubleshooting Tools

Every hacker and network admin needs a set of tools to diagnose connectivity issues and explore networks.

## Core Tools

### 1. Ping
Used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network. It measures the round-trip time for messages.

### 2. Traceroute
Shows the path that a packet takes to reach its destination, listing all the routers (hops) along the way.

### 3. Netstat
Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.

<TerminalWindow

  command="ping google.com" 
  output="Pinging google.com [142.250.190.46] with 32 bytes of data:\nReply from 142.250.190.46: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=117" 
/>

### 4. Nslookup / Dig
Used to query DNS records for a domain name.
