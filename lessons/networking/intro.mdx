# Introduction to Networking

Networking is the practice of connecting computers together to share resources and communicate. Whether you're sending an email, watching a video, or hacking a server, it all happens over a network.

## What is a Network?

A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications.

### LAN vs WAN
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** A network that is confined to a relatively small area, like a building or home.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** A network that spans a large geographical area, such as the Internet.

## How Data Travels

Data is broken down into small pieces called **packets**. These packets travel through various devices like routers and switches to reach their destination.

  dest="8.8.8.8" 
  protocol="DNS" 
  flags="QUERY"
