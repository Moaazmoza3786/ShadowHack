# Ethics and Rules of Engagement (RoE)

## The Difference Between Hacking and Pentesting
Technically, a black-hat hacker and a penetration tester use the exact same tools (`nmap`, `metasploit`, `burpsuite`). The **only** difference is **permission**.

Without written permission, even a simple port scan is illegal in many jurisdictions. The **Rules of Engagement (RoE)** is the formal contract that defines how you are allowed to hack.

## The RoE Document Structure
A professional RoE is not just a "Get Out of Jail Free" card; it is a technical constraint document.

### Critical Components of an RoE
1.  **IP Ranges / Domains:** Explicitly list what is in scope.
2.  **Exclusions:** What is *forbidden*? (e.g., "Do not test the main production database server during business hours").
3.  **Testing Window:** Specific dates and times (e.g., "Mon-Fri, 9 AM - 5 PM" or "Weekends only").
4.  **Emergency Contact:** Who to call if you accidentally crash a server.

## Ethical Hacking Principles
1.  **Do No Harm:** Minimize risk to the client's operations. If you suspect an exploit might crash a service, **do not run it** without specific authorization and a fallback plan.
2.  **Privacy:** You may encounter sensitive data (PII, credit cards). You are a professional; you do not look at, copy, or share this data unless necessary for the proof of concept.
3.  **Transparency:** Do not hide your tracks from the client (unless it's a Red Team engagement). Report all findings honestly.

## Practical Scenario: The "White Card"
In a physical or intense Red Team engagement, if you are caught by security guards or police, you present your "White Card" (Authorization Letter).

<Note type="warning">
**Scenario:** You find a legacy server (192.168.1.15) that is vulnerable to *EternalBlue*. However, it is **not** in the list of IPs provided in the RoE.
**Action:** YOU DO NOT TOUCH IT. You report it as a scope discrepancy to the client and ask for an amendment.
</Note>

## Code of Conduct Example
When running a noisy scan, you might be asked to limit your rate to avoid triggering intrusion detection systems (IDS) or crashing fragile IoT devices.

<TerminalSimulator 
    cmd="nmap -T1 -p- 10.10.10.5" 
    output={`Starting Nmap 7.93...
Note: Timing level 1 (Sneaky) selected. Scans will be very slow.
Scanning 10.10.10.5 [65535 ports]
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.5
...`} 
/>

Using `-T1` (Sneaky) ensures you are respecting potential bandwidth or stability constraints agreed upon in the RoE.
