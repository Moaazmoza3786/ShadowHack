# Blue Team vs Red Team vs Purple Team

## The Colors of Infosec
In cybersecurity, we use military terminology to describe the different roles in an engagement. Understanding where you fit is crucial for career development.

## 1. Red Team (The Aggressors)
Red Teamers emulate real-world adversaries (APTs, Criminal Syndicates).
- **Goal:** Test the effectiveness of the Blue Team's detection and response.
- **Mindset:** "How can I get in without being seen?"
- **Tools:** Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Custom Malware.
- **Duration:** Weeks to Months.

## 2. Blue Team (The Defenders)
The SOC Analysts, Incident Responders, and Threat Hunters who protect the organization 24/7.
- **Goal:** Detect, Contain, and Eradicate threats.
- **Mindset:** "What is normal behavior, and what is an anomaly?"
- **Tools:** SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel), EDR (CrowdStrike), Firewalls.

## 3. Purple Team (The Collaborators)
A collaborative exercise, not necessarily a separate permanent team. It involves Red and Blue sitting together.
- **Scenario:** Red runs an attack (e.g., T1003 OS Credential Dumping).
- **Check:** Does Blue see it?
- **Optimization:** If not, they tune the SIEM alert together **in real-time**.

### Simulation Example: Identifying a Red Team Attack
A Red Teamer runs a simple `whoami` command. To a Blue Teamer, this looks like a process execution event.

<CodeBlock language="json" showLineNumbers code={`// Blue Team Log View (Sysmon Event ID 1)
{
  "EventID": 1,
  "Image": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe",
  "CommandLine": "whoami",
  "User": "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM",
  "ParentImage": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
  "ParentCommandLine": "cmd.exe /c whoami"
}
`} />

<Note type="warning">
**Detection Tip:** While `whoami` is a standard command, seeing it executed by `SYSTEM` immediately after `cmd.exe` spawned from `apache.exe` (a web server) is a 99% indicator of a Webshell.
</Note>

## Which Path is For You?
*   **Like breaking things?** Go Red.
*   **Like investigation and puzzles?** Go Blue.
*   **Like teaching and optimizing?** Go Purple.

<Quiz 
    question="During a Purple Team exercise, the Red Team executes a specific malware sample. The Blue Team checks their SIEM and sees nothing. What is the immediate next step?" 
    options={[
        "The Red Team mocks the Blue Team for failing",
        "The engagement ends immediately",
        "They work together to create a new detection rule for that specific behavior",
        "The Red Team deletes the malware and tries a different one"
    ]} 
    answer="They work together to create a new detection rule for that specific behavior"
