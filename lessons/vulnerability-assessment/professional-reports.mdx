# Generating Professional Reports

## The "Product" is the Report
You can hack the Pentagon, but if you can't write a report about it, you didn't do anything. The **Report** is the only tangible deliverable the client receives.

A standard report has two distinct audiences:
1.  **The Executive:** Cares about Risk, Money, and Brand Reputation.
2.  **The Engineer:** Cares about Reproducing the Steps and Applying the Fix (Mifigation).

## 1. The Executive Summary
This section must be written in **business language**, not technical jargon.

<CodeBlock language="markdown" showLineNumbers code={`# Executive Summary
**Engagement:** Annual Penetration Test 2026
**Overall Risk:** High

**High-Level Findings:**
During the assessment, we identified a critical vulnerability in the "Billing Portal" that allows an unauthenticated attacker to access customer data. This poses a significant financial and reputational risk.

**Recommendation:**
We recommend taking the Billing Portal offline immediately for emergency patching.

**Do NOT say:** "We found a Blind Boolean SQL Injection in the `id` parameter."
**Do say:** "We found a way to steal the database."

## 2. Technical Findings Table
This is for the developers. It needs to be precise.

### Key Components of a Finding
*   **Title:** Clear and concise (e.g., "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)").
*   **Severity:** Critical/High/Medium/Low (CVSS Score).
*   **Status:** Exploited / Verified / Potential.
*   **Description:** What is the bug?
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Step-by-step instructions (Screenshots, HTTP Requests).
*   **Remediation:** How to fix it (Code examples or Configuration changes).

`} />

## 3. Writing Effective Remediation
Don't just say "Fix the code." Give them the solution.

**Bad:** "Prevent XSS."
**Good:** "Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and use context-aware output encoding. For React, ensure you do not use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`."

## 4. The "Do Not" List
*   **Don't:** Include massive raw scanner logs (put them in the Appendix).
*   **Don't:** Use aggressive or insulting language ("Your admin is stupid").
*   **Don't:** Share client data in the report examples (Redact it!).
