# Manual Validation: False Positives vs True Positives

## The "Human" in the Loop
A scanner might tell you a target is vulnerable to **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)**.
-   **If you are right:** You get a shell.
-   **If you are wrong:** You might crash the production server with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).

**Manual Validation** is the process of confirming a vulnerability exists *without* indiscriminately launching exploits.

## 1. Verifying False Positives
Scanners often rely on "Banner Grabbing".
-   **Scenario:** Server sends header `Apache/2.4.49`.
-   **Scanner:** "Critical! Path Traversal Vulnerability!"
-   **Reality:** The Admin backported the patch but didn't update the version string.

### How to Validate?
Send a benign probe that triggers the *behavior*, not the *impact*.

<CodeBlock language="bash" showLineNumbers code={`# Payload: Try to access /etc/passwd (Path Traversal)
# Don't try to delete a file. Just try to READ something standard.

curl -v "http://10.10.10.5/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/etc/passwd"
`} />

**Result Analysis:**
-   **HTTP 200 OK** + `root:x:0:0...` visible in body -> **TRUE POSITIVE**.
-   **HTTP 403 Forbidden** -> **FALSE POSITIVE** (or blocked by WAF).
-   **HTTP 404 Not Found** -> **FALSE POSITIVE**.

## 2. Low Hanging Fruit vs. Critical Logic Bugs
Scanners are great at finding "Old Software" (Low Hanging Fruit). They are terrible at finding "Business Logic Errors".

### Example: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
-   **URL:** `http://bank.com/account/view?id=1001`
-   **Scan:** "Safe" (No SQLi, No XSS).
-   **Manual Test:** Change `id=1001` to `id=1002`.
-   **Result:** You see someone else's bank balance.

<Note type="warning">
**Scanner Limitation:** No automated tool in the world can understand that User A should not see User B's data if the page loads correctly (HTTP 200). This requires **Human Intelligence**.
</Note>

## 3. The Evidence Matrix
When reporting, you need proof.

| Finding | Weak Proof (Scanner) | Strong Proof (Manual) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XSS** | "Parameter 'q' appears vulnerable" | `<script>alert(1)</script>` executed in browser (Screenshot). |
| **SQLi** | "Response time delay detected" | Extracted database version: `MariaDB 10.1`. |
| **Default Creds** | "Possible default account" | Screenshot of logged-in Admin Dashboard. |

    question="You verify a reported SQL Injection by entering a single quote (') into the login field. The application returns '500 Internal Server Error'. What does this indicate?" 
    options={[
        "The application is definitely secure",
        "The scanner was wrong",
        "The application is likely vulnerable (True Positive) as it mishandled the input",
        "The server is down"
