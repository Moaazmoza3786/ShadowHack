# Automated Vulnerability Scanning: Nessus & OpenVAS

## The Robot Army
Manual enumeration is precise, but slow. **Vulnerability Scanners** (like Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys) are automated tools that fire thousands of non-destructive exploits at a target to identify potential holes.

## How Scanners Work
A scanner doesn't "think". It follows a database of known signatures.

    A -->|3. Compare with DB| C{Match Signature?}

    C -- No --> E[Mark Safe]

## 1. Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed Scans
This is the single most important concept in vulnerability management.

### Non-Credentialed (Black Box)
The scanner sees what an outsider sees.
-   **Finds:** Missing headers, SSL issues, outdated banners.
-   **Misses:** Local patch levels, registry settings, file permissions.

### Credentialed (White Box)
You give the scanner a username/password (e.g., Domain Admin or Root). It logs in and queries the OS directly.
-   **Finds:** *Everything*. "Chrome is outdated", "Missing KB500123", "Weak Password Policy".
-   **Accuracy:** Much higher.

## 2. Nessus Essentials
Nessus is the industry standard. It uses "Plugins" to detect vulnerabilities.

<TerminalSimulator 
    cmd="Starting scan 'Critical Infrastructure'..." 
    output={`Scan Name: Critical Structure
Policy: Advanced Scan
Status: Running
...
[+] Plugin 11011 (SMB Signing Not Required) - Medium
[+] Plugin 33850 (Unsupported Unix OS) - Critical
[+] Plugin 104743 (Apache 2.4.49 < 2.4.50 Path Traversal) - Critical
    -> Exploitable with Metasploit (Project Mayhem)
    -> CVSS v3: 9.8 (Critical)
`} 
/>

## 3. OpenVAS (Greenbone)
The open-source alternative to Nessus. Great for budget-constrained assessments but requires more manual tuning.

## 4. The Peril of False Positives
Scanners lie.
-   **False Positive:** Scanner says "Vulnerable to SQLi", but you check and it's just a weird error message. **Result:** Wasted time.
-   **False Negative:** Scanner says "Safe", but there is a blind SQLi it missed. **Result:** You get hacked.

<Note type="warning">
**Professional Rule:** NEVER copy-paste a Nessus report directly to a client. You must manually verify every Critical and High finding; otherwise, you are just a "Paper Pusher," not a Pentester.
</Note>

### Interpreting Confidence
Most scanners assign a "Confidence Level".
-   **100% (Exploited):** The scanner actually triggered the bug.
-   **70% (Banner Check):** The scanner saw "Apache 2.4.49" and *assumed* it's vulnerable, but didn't test it. (Backported patches often trigger this).

<Quiz 
    question="Why is a Credentialed Scan superior to a Non-Credentialed Scan?" 
    options={[
        "It is faster because it skips the port scan",
        "It allows the scanner to log in and query the local software inventory directly",
        "It inevitably exploits the vulnerabilities to prove they exist",
        "It is undetectable by the Blue Team"
