# Cleanup & Reporting

The final phase of any professional penetration test is cleaning up your tools and documenting your work in a detailed report.

## The Cleanup Phase

Professional ethics require you to leave the customer's systems as you found them (minus the security holes).

- **Remove Tools:** Delete any scripts, binaries, or wordlists you uploaded.
- **Revert Configs:** Remove any persistence mechanisms (cron jobs, registry keys).
- **Clear Logs:** Be careful here! In a real engagement, you might need to leave logs for the blue team to analyze your footprint.

## Reporting

A good report is the only "product" a customer receives. It must include:
- **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview for management.
- **Technical Breakdown:** Detailed steps for each vulnerability found.
- **Risk Rating:** Using systems like CVSS.
- **Remediation:** CLEAR instructions on how to fix the issues.
