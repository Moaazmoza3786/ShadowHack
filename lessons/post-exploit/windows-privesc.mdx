# Windows Privilege Escalation

Escalating privileges on Windows involves looking for misconfigured services, unquoted service paths, or kernel vulnerabilities.

## Common Techniques

### 1. Token Impersonation
Windows uses tokens to manage user permissions. Attackers can steal tokens from high-privilege processes (like SYSTEM) to elevate their own privileges.

### 2. Unquoted Service Paths
If a service path has spaces and is not enclosed in quotes, Windows might misinterpret the path and execute a malicious file instead.

### 3. Kernel Exploits
Just like Linux, outdated Windows versions are vulnerable to kernel exploits (e.g., PrintNightmare).

  command="whoami /priv" 
  output="PRIVILEGES INFORMATION\n----------------------\nPrivilege Name                Description                          State\n============================= ==================================== ========\nSeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after auth      Enabled"

The `SeImpersonatePrivilege` is a goldmine for attackers. It can often be exploited using tools like **PrintSpoofer** or **GodPotato**.
