# Persistence Techniques

Persistence involves creating ways to maintain access to a target system even after a reboot or a password change.

## Common Methods

### 1. SSH Keys
Adding your public key to the `/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on a Linux box.

### 2. Cron Jobs
Creating a scheduled task that executes a reverse shell every hour.

### 3. Registry Run Keys (Windows)
Adding an entry to `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` to execute your malware on login.
