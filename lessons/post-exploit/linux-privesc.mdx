# Linux Privilege Escalation

Gaining an initial foothold is just the beginning. To fully compromise a Linux system, you must become the **root** user.

## Common Techniques

### 1. SUID Files
Files with the SUID (Set User ID) bit allow a user to run the file with the permissions of the file owner (often root). If these files are exploitable, you can get root access.

<TerminalWindow 
  title="Finding SUID Files" 
  command="find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null" 
  output="/usr/bin/passwd\n/usr/bin/sudo\n/usr/local/bin/custom_backup_script" 
/>

### 2. Kernel Exploits
If the system is running an outdated kernel, you might be able to use a known vulnerability (like Dirty Cow) to escalate privileges.

### 3. Sudo Privileges
Use `sudo -l` to see if your user can run any commands as root without a password.

<TerminalWindow 
  title="Checking Sudo Privs" 
  command="sudo -l" 
  output="User user may run the following commands on linux-box:\n    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/awk" 
/>

<InfoBox type="important">
If you can run `awk` as root, you can get a root shell using: `sudo awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'`
</InfoBox>
