# Pivoting & Tunneling

Pivoting is the process of using one compromised system as a bridge to attack other systems that were previously unreachable.

## The Pivot Concept

Imagine you compromise a Web Server. That server has a second network card connected to an internal network. You can use the web server to "pivot" into that internal network.

### Tunneling
Tunneling (or Port Forwarding) wraps one protocol inside another. For example, using an SSH tunnel to forward traffic from your machine to an internal database server.

<PacketView 
  source="Attacker" 
  dest="Internal DB (via Web Server)" 
  protocol="SSH Tunnel (3306)" 
  flags="Forward" 
  seq="100" 
/>

## Core Tools
- **Chisel:** A fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP.
- **Socat:** The Swiss Army knife for relaying data.
- **Metasploit Autoroute:** Automatically routes traffic through a Meterpreter session.

  command="./chisel server -p 8000 --reverse" 
  output="server: Fingerprint: 2a:...\nserver: Listening on 0.0.0.0:8000..."
