# Process Management & Services (systemctl)

Linux is a multitasking environment. Multiple users can run multiple programs at the same time. Each running program is called a **Process**. As a hacker, you need to know how to list, manage, and terminate processes to hide your tracks or maintain persistence.

## Viewing Running Processes

Every process has a unique identifier called a **PID (Process ID)**.

### 1. `ps` (Process Status)
Shows a snapshot of current processes.
- `ps aux`: Shows all processes for all users.

<TerminalWindow cmd="ps aux | grep sshd" output="root       842  0.0  0.1  15816  7252 ?        Ss   12:00   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
[!] SSH Daemon detected with PID 842" />

### 2. `top` or `htop`
Provides a live, interactive view of the system's resource usage (CPU, RAM, Processes).

---

## Terminating Processes

Sometimes a program hangs, or you need to kill a security service. Use the `kill` command followed by the PID.

- `kill -9 12347`: Forcefully kill process 12347 (SIGKILL).
- `killall nmap`: Kill all running instances of nmap.

---

## Services & Systemd

Most modern Linux systems use **Systemd** to manage "Services" (programs that run in the background). We use the `systemctl` command to manage them.

### Common Service Commands:
- `systemctl status ssh`: Check if the SSH service is running.
- `systemctl start apache2`: Start the web server.
- `systemctl stop ufw`: Stop the firewall (Useful during testing!).
- `systemctl enable/disable`: Set a service to start (or not) on boot.

<InfoBox type="tip">
If you gain access to a server and want your backdoors to survive a reboot, you might try to create a new systemd service that starts your malicious listener automatically.
</InfoBox>

## Interactive Exercise

Try to identify the status of the web server in the terminal.

<TerminalWindow cmd="systemctl is-active apache2" output="active
[!] Web Server is ONLINE" />
