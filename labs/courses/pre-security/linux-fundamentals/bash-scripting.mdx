# Bash Scripting Basics for Hackers

A key difference between a script kiddie and a professional hacker is **Automation**. If you find yourself running the same 5 commands over and over, you should write a script.

In Linux, we use **Bash Scripting** to automate tasks, scan networks, and even exploit vulnerabilities.

## The Anatomy of a Script

Every Bash script must start with a "Shebang" line. This tells the system which interpreter to use.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment

echo "Hello, Antigravity Pilot!"
```

### Making it Executable
Before you can run your script, you must give it "Execute" permissions.
<TerminalWindow cmd="chmod +x myscript.sh; ./myscript.sh" output="Hello, Antigravity Pilot!" />

## Variables & User Input

Variables allow you to store data for later use.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the target IP:"
read target_ip
echo "Scanning $target_ip now..."
```

---

## Loops: The Power of Automation

Loops allow you to run a command multiple times. For example, a simple ping-sweep to see which machines are alive on a network:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple Ping Sweep
for ip in $(seq 1 254); do
    ping -c 1 192.168.1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
done
```

<InfoBox type="note">
The `&` at the end of the ping command runs each ping in the **background**, making the scan much faster.
</InfoBox>

---

## Conditional Logic (If/Else)

Scripts can make decisions based on the result of a command.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if grep "root" /etc/passwd; then
    echo "Root user found!"
else
    echo "Something is very wrong."
fi
```

## Interactive Script Simulation

Let's simulate a simple port scanner script.

<TerminalWindow cmd="./scanner.sh 10.10.10.1" output="[*] Probing target 10.10.10.1...
[+] Port 22 is OPEN
[+] Port 80 is OPEN
[+] Port 443 is OPEN
Scan Complete." />

## Knowledge Check

<Quiz 
  question="What is the 'Shebang' line at the start of a Bash script?"
  options={["#!/bin/bash", "#bash-only", "start bash", "// bin/bash"]}
  answer="#!/bin/bash"
  explanation="The shebang (#!) followed by the path to the interpreter tells the OS how to execute the script."
/>
