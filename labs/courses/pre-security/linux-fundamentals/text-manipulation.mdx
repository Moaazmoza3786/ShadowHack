# Grepping & Piping (Text Manipulation)

In Linux, output from one command can be sent into another command. This is called **Piping**. Combined with powerful text search tools like **Grep**, it allows you to scan through thousands of lines of data in milliseconds.

---

## The Pipe Operator (`|`)

The pipe operator `|` takes the output of the command on the left and passes it as the input to the command on the right.

### Example: Finding a User
If you want to see if the user `alice` exists in the system password file:
<TerminalWindow cmd="cat /etc/passwd | grep alice" output="alice:x:1001:1001:Alice Smith,,,:/home/alice:/bin/bash" />

## Grep: The Global Regular Expression Print

`grep` is used to search for specific patterns of text within files or output.

### Common Flags:
- `-i`: Case-insensitive search (finds 'Alice' or 'alice').
- `-v`: Invert match (show everything EXCEPT the pattern).
- `-r`: Recursive search (search through all files in a folder).
- `-color`: Highlight the matching text.

## Other Essential Text Tools

While grep is the king of search, these tools help you manipulate the output:

### 1. `awk` (The Data Extractor)
Used to print specific columns.
<TerminalWindow cmd="ls -l | awk '{print $9}'" output="[Lists only the filenames, excluding permissions and owner]" />

### 2. `sed` (Stream Editor)
Used to find and replace text.
`cat file.txt | sed 's/old/new/g'`

### 3. `sort` & `uniq`
Used to organize data and remove duplicates. Useful for processing wordlists or log files.
`cat logs.txt | sort | uniq`

## The "Hacker's One-Liner"

Imagine you have a massive log file and you want to see the 5 most frequent IP addresses that tried to log in:

<TerminalWindow cmd="cat auth.log | grep 'Failed password' | awk '{print $11}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 5" output="  152 192.168.1.10
   87 10.0.0.5
   42 172.16.0.12

## Knowledge Check

<Quiz 
  question="Which command would you use to find all occurrences of the word 'password' in a file, regardless of capitalization?"
  options={["grep -v 'password'", "grep -i 'password'", "cat 'password'", "ls -p"]}
  answer="grep -i 'password'"
  explanation="The -i flag makes the search case-insensitive, matching 'Password', 'PASSWORD', or 'password'."
/>
