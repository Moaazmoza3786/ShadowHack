# Shell Navigation & Basic Commands

In the world of cybersecurity, the **CLI (Command Line Interface)** is your primary tool. While a GUI (Graphical User Interface) is easy to use, the CLI is faster, more powerful, and essential for automation.

The program that interprets your commands is called the **Shell**. The most common shell in Linux is **Bash** (Bourne Again SHell).

## Survival Commands

Before you can hack, you must learn to walk. Here are the core commands for moving around the system.

### 1. Where am I? (`pwd`)
Stands for **Print Working Directory**. It shows your current location in the filesystem.

<TerminalWindow cmd="pwd" output="/home/explorer" />

### 2. What's in here? (`ls`)
Stands for **List**. It shows files and folders in your current directory.
- `ls -l`: Long listing (shows permissions and size).
- `ls -a`: Show hidden files (files starting with a `.`).

### 3. Moving around (`cd`)
Stands for **Change Directory**.
- `cd /etc`: Go to the `/etc` folder.
- `cd ..`: Go up one level.
- `cd ~`: Go to your home directory.

## Handling Files

### Creating & Reading
- `touch filename.txt`: Create an empty file.
- `mkdir folder_name`: Create a new directory.
- `cat filename.txt`: Read the contents of a file.
- `head -n 5 file.txt`: View the first 5 lines.
- `tail -n 5 file.txt`: View the last 5 lines.

### Copying & Moving
- `cp source destination`: Copy a file.
- `mv source destination`: Move or **rename** a file.
- `rm filename`: Delete a file. **Warning: There is no Trash can in the CLI.**

## Finding Help

You don't need to memorize every command. Linux has built-in manuals.

<TerminalWindow cmd="man ls" output="LS(1) User Commands
NAME: ls - list directory contents
DESCRIPTION: List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default)..." />

## Knowledge Check

<Quiz 
  question="Which command is used to see all files in a directory, including hidden ones?"
